This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
## Muy Importante!!!
Next.js uses the .env.local file to store environment variables, but the Prisma ORM cannot read from that file, so you must use the dotenv-cli to run Prisma cli commands.

Prefix every Prisma cli command with ```dotenv -e .env.local -- ```

For example, in order to generate the Prisma client, which would normally be ```npx prisma generate```, you would instead run the following command:

```bash
dotenv -e .env.local -- npx prisma generate
```

I have added some scripts to the package.json for some of the most common commands to make this easier. In this case, you can simply run ```npm run generate``` to generate the client

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
